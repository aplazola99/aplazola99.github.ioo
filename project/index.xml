Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Dog popularity, intelligence, and breed info.
Introduction Recently, I have been into dogs and raising my pups, I did quite a bit of background research on dog breeds before selecting which breed was the best at fitting into my lifestyle plus my past experiences of raising certain dog breeds like German Shepherds, Labs, and Rottweilers.
This got me to thinking that I automatically wanted to do my project one over dog breed intelligence and comparing it to dog breed popularity.</description>
